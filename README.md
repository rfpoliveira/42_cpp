 # 42_cpp

This were my first steps into c++ in the course but seemed pretty intuitive given all the previous experience with C.

# Modulo 0 - Basics
  This modulo was basicly to get a grasp of the basic differences of C and C++, the std namespace, way to print to the screen and get input from the user for example.

# Modulo 1 - Classes and References

# Modulo 2 - Fixed Point

# Modulo 3 - Inheritance

# Modulo 4 - Polymorphism and Abstract Classes

# Modulo 5 - Exceptions

# Modulo 6 - Casting in C++ (convertions bettewn int, float, double and char)

# Modulo 7 - Templates

# Modulo 8 - Templated Containers and Iterators
